⚽ Premier League 2018–2019 – Data Visualization Project

This project explores the 2018–2019 Premier League season through structured data modeling and interactive visualization using Power BI.
The dashboard is built from two raw Excel datasets: Match data (results and goal timings), Team squad and scoring statistics.

The season featured an exceptional title race between Liverpool and Manchester City, which shaped the analytical narrative of the project.
The dashboard is structured around the following views:

Goals – General overview

Goal Timings – Temporal analysis of when goals were scored, including decisive goals

Match Scenarios – Matches categorized by game scenarios

Title Race Dynamics – The battle throughout the season

Team Season Performance – Detailed team-level performance metrics

Head-to-Head Analysis – Direct comparison between contenders

Team Comparison – Cross-team performance analysis

Squad Performers – Player-level contribution and scoring impact

The project focuses on transforming raw datasets into a structured relational model, defining meaningful KPIs, and enabling interactive exploration of performance patterns and competitive dynamics across the season.
Users can interact with the visualizations to explore trends, compare teams, and analyze match dynamics throughout the league campaign.
